	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity and efficient : Time complexity is a measure of the amount of computational resources, particularly time, required by an algorithm to solve a problem, and efficiency refers to the optimization of these resources, with lower time complexity generally indicating a more efficient algorithm.</p>
	<p>Linear Space Complexity - O(n): In this case, the memory required by the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input.Logarithmic Space Complexity - O(log n): This type of <b>Space Complexity</b> means that the memory required by the algorithm grows logarithmically with the size of the input</p>
